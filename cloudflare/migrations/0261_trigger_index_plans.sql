-- 0261: index-friendly plans for per-write triggers, plus the Not-paid audit lookup index.
--
-- Schema only: no table row is inserted, updated or deleted.
--
-- 1. Catalog-cost triggers (0195 names, last defined by 0256). Without
--    statistics `is_active = 1 AND id IN (...)` picks an (is_active, ...)
--    index and walks every active product, twice per lot quantity change
--    (2,024 rows per update at 1,000 products). `+is_active` only stops that
--    index choice; the predicate is unchanged, so the plan is a products
--    primary-key search. Text = catalogCostReviewTriggersSql() in
--    src/lib/catalogCostRecompute.ts.
-- 2. Name-grouping triggers (trg_products_ai_name_key and
--    trg_products_au_name_active from 0010, trg_products_ad_name_key last
--    defined by 0165): the same `+is_active`, so the group lookup uses
--    idx_products_name_key_pg (2,032 rows per product insert, 3,017 per
--    rename at 1,000 products). Bodies otherwise byte-identical.
-- 3. idx_audit_logs_sale_ref: the exact expression and filter of the
--    payment-correction lookups in routes/sales.ts (sale list and
--    saleAllowsPaymentCorrection), Records/Performance/2026-09-27/OPT-scan-2.md
--    item 1. Query text unchanged, so results cannot change.
--
-- Assertions: a failed check reads a malformed JSON path and aborts the file.
-- Idempotent: DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS + CREATE, CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS.
-- Pinned by scripts/test-migration-0261-trigger-index-plans-native.cjs.
--
-- RECOVERY (schema only, restores the 0256/0010/0165 definitions):
--   DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_audit_logs_sale_ref;
--   DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS for the nine trigger names below, then run
--   the six CREATE TRIGGER statements of 0256_validated_catalog_cost.sql
--   (from catalog_cost_on_hand_stock_insert_0195 to the end of the file;
--   equal to catalogCostReviewTriggersSql({ primaryKeyPlan: false })),
--   the trg_products_ai_name_key and trg_products_au_name_active statements
--   of 0010_product_name_grouping.sql, and the trg_products_ad_name_key
--   statement of 0165_product_same_name_merge.sql.
