// ONE WORD for customer credit (owner, Sep 6 2026):
//
//   "i already mentioned the credit amount/unpaid make it consistent just use
//    credit don't use both, it cause confusion... don't minus for credit amount
//    add into revenue and profit, just note the credit amount is that much so
//    instead of $-n... just $n... so we know no need to remove from profit"
//
// One sale status carried FIVE user-visible names at once -- "Awaiting
// Payment", "Not Paid", "Unpaid net sales", "Pending", "awaiting payment" --
// and the Khmer pack carried three ("រង់ចាំការទូទាត់", "មិនទាន់បង់",
// "ឥណទាន"). This pins the single word in both packs: **Credit** / **ឥណទាន**.
//
// It also pins the two hints that were factually WRONG about the arithmetic,
// which is what made the wording confusing in the first place:
//   * rpt_hint_pending_revenue said "Not counted in revenue above" while
//     rpt_hint_pending, three keys away, said "Included in sales, revenue, and
//     profit". Both described the same figure. The kernel (recognizedExpr is
//     `<> 'cancelled'`) includes it, so the second one was right.
//   * rpt_hint_pending_profit said "no figure above includes it".
//   * rpt_hint_sales_list said credit rows "show 0" -- routes/reports.ts's
//     net_revenue_usd column gates on `recognized`, so a credit row shows its
//     full revenue, not 0.
//
// SUPPLIER credit is a different ledger (money the shop owes a supplier) and
// is deliberately left alone; the keep-set below is the positive control that
// proves this test can tell the two apart instead of matching "credit"
// everywhere.
//
