## Repeat Consistency

Repeat consistency checks are skipped for single-cycle runs.

Full repeat values are retained in `ops/docs/reference/PHASE29-AUDIT.json`; this Markdown report summarizes long arrays and objects with counts, hashes, and previews.

## Boundary

- Generated/runtime bulk is measured through the generated-bulk audit and guarded by policy.
- Folder/schema consistency is checked through organization and schema audits.
- Reference-producing checks run one at a time to avoid Windows file-lock
  contention on generated Markdown/JSON reports; bounded-parallel guardrails run
  after them, then organization audit scans a coherent docs/reference tree.
- Code-flow and large-module candidates are measured through the performance/code-flow scan.
- Language/runtime conversion candidates are measured through the language/runtime audit.
- Docker/release cleanup boundaries are checked by the Docker release verifier.
- Destructive cleanup still requires an explicit cleanup command or retention script, never this audit.
- Console output is concise by default; run with `--verbose` to stream full child-check output while debugging.
